 step 1. C:\Users\acer\Desktop\auth-mern-app\backend> npm init -y
 step 2.  npm i express jsonwebtoken bcrypt body-parser dotenv mongoose joi cors
 step 3. express for framework
         jsonwebtoken for JWT token - look its like a token that a client gets while he signs in - now say after logging in if our client
         wants so information that requires authintication then this token will be use to authenticate the user.
         bcrypt - to encrypt and decrypt stuff using hash functions and stuff to make more secure
         dotenv - for managing enviroment variable
         body-parser for allowing request body to the server
         mongoose- database 
         joi - server side validation (its like say you gave a validation that the pasword must be min 4 lenght so it will display if     the password is wrong)
         cors - to allow other request to come to our port
step 4. do what you want to do in the react app (read commnets there) and create the .env file to get whatever
step 5. to better orginase things do create folders {Models,Controllers,Routes, Middlewares}
step 6. db.js
